# VVV for OTGS

Under development. When this project becomes at least partially usable, I will announce it.

## List of ideas

TODOs and ideas that need further investigation.

- Add Riccardo's checkout tool
    - create docs for it (perhaps Riccardo can help)
- Checkout (clone) WPML, too
- Also integrate boxes for older PHP versions from https://github.com/tierra/wp-vagrant
    - add proper provisioning
- shortcut shell scripts for commands that need to be run inside vagrant box
- shortcuts to update everything from trunk
- bash aliases
    - wp cli: activate all toolset plugins and theme
    - the usual linux hacks
- proper documentation
- script to generate Customfile that will turn the VVV into 32bit
